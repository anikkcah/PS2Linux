# PS2Linux
an easy way to install Linux OS in PlayStation 2.

A simple Guide:

(Note: This guide is aimed at slim PS2, I tried it on my PS2 model SCPH-75008.)
(It would work on all PS2 models that can launch a Linux Bootloader. So, feel free to try.)

Requirements:

1. A software mod(such as FreeMCBoot OS) -----OR------ a modchip(modbo mod) for your Playstation2 to launch bootloader.

2. A memory card of atleast 8MB, but preferably 16 MB, 32 MB or 128 MB (as per your requirements).
    This memory card will permanently hold your boot loader configuration, Linux Kernel, and RamDisk, and config file together will         takeup
    4.5MB(approximately) plus Kernel, RamDisk, and config file together will take up atleast 7MB(=9.5MB if you choose to include the         generic RamDisk as well).
    
    (Remember: You have only 2 Memory Card slots, unless you are using an Memory card port expansion(don't know it is possible or not)
                you will likely need the extra space provided by an above-average size memory card to store your saved games.)
                
3. A USB disk of atleast 8 GB (can use a USB flash drive(pen drive) or external IDE/SATA HDD/SSD will work).

4. Access to an existing install of a Debian based system.
    If you are using macOS or Windows system, I recommend using VirtualBox, but make sure you install the guest additions to more easily
    transfer the required files.
    
5. A USB 1.1 or 2.0 Keyboard.
    While Sony's PS2 Linux and BlackRhino Linux Live DVD come with an onscreen keyboard,
    this installation will use Debian 5, which requires a proper physical keyboard.
